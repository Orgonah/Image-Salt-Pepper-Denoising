# Image-Salt-Pepper-Denoising

This project uses matlab to denoise salt&pepper noise from images.
By running MAIN.m on different image samples with different noise persentages you get the results in the "Images" folder.

In "Extra - 255 0 pixels in the orrg pictures" folder you can see that the code works fine on images that have natural white or black areas.

In "Extra - Median bests" folder you can see the median method for denoising and you can compare it to projects method.
